The Domain Name System (DNS) associates various information with domain names; most importantly, it serves as the "phone book" for the Internet by translating human-readable computer hostnames, e.g. www.example.com, into IP addresses, e.g. 208.77.188.166, which networking equipment needs to deliver information. A DNS also stores other information such as the list of mail servers that accept email for a given domain. By providing a worldwide keyword-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of contemporary Internet use.
* In the TCP/IP world each machine is uniquely identified by its IP Address.
* IPAddress – 4 bytes = 32 bits
* Numbers are hard to remember, names are easier.
* Each machine is assigned a name in a tree-like structure.
* Domain Names (FQDN) or URLs are used by users – www.google.com
* IP Address needed by programs – 66.249.93.104
* The DNS Service Provides IP Name Resolution 
* DNS is a distributed database of Domain Names and their corresponding IP Addresses 
* RFC 1034, 1035  
* A hierarchical naming system used to give each server on the Internet a unique name. 
* www.google.com  (URL or FQDN) HostName.Domain.TLD 
* HostName and the Domain Name = Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

Sources of Domain Names 
* ICANN (Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers) Oversees the Domain Name Registration Process (www.icann.org)
* Shared Database of Domain Names (Master Database)
* Maintained under Contract by Network Solutions (originally InterNIC)
* Domain registrars- keep things organized
* Network Solutions, America Online, register.com, Tucows.com, RNC.RO
* Complete List of Registrars:
* http://www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html
Registering a Domain Name 
* Contact a Domain Register 
* Choose a Unique Domain Name http://www.rnc.ro/ or other Register!
* To See Who Currently Owns a Name http://www.rnc.ro (Whois Query) or whois(Unix)
* Register the Domain Name 
* $10-35 a year 
* You need the FQDN’s Names and IP Addresses of (2) Two DNS Servers That Store DNS Information for Your Domain
Resource records
RR=(Domain_name, Time_to_live, Class, Type, Value )

Domain_name–the domain to which the resource belongs
Time_to_live – how stable the record is
Class – IN (Internet), Chaos, etc
Type – types of the record
Value – the record value

DNS Software 	
* Resolver 
* Built into Client TCP/IP Software 
* Ask Designated Name Server for IP Address When Client Enters FQDN (URL) 
* Name Server 
* a.k.a DNS Server (Available with Most OS’s) 
* Retrieves IP Addresses for Clients 
* Supplies IP Address to other Name Servers 
* Provided by the Internet, ISP, or business


DNS Name Solving
* Originally one single central huge table.
* Hierarchical structure:
* Root DNS servers (serving .com .org .net, etc)
* Domain servers – serve domain queries.
* Types of queries:
* Recursive queries
* Non-recursive queries

DNS – Non Recursive & Caching
Connect at www.yahoo.com
1. Ask the Root Server for the .com ( a.gtld-servers.net )
2. a.gtld-servers.net asks the DNS server of the yahoo.com (ns1.yahoo.com)
3. ns1.yahoo.com determines that www.yahoo.com => is an alias for www.yahoo.akadns.net
4. Response gets back to the client www.yahoo.akadns.net

DNS Recursive & caching
Connect at www.yahoo.com
1. Ask Local Server(LS) for the www.yahoo.com
2. (LS) 
1. www.yahoo.com – cached 216.109.118.68
2. Or asks Root Server for the .com 
3. (LS) asks a.gtld-servers.net who is the DNS server for yahoo.com => ns1.yahoo.com
4. Ask ns1.yahoo.com who is www.yahoo.com => is alias for www.yahoo.akadns.net
5. Ask ns1.yahoo.com who is www.yahoo.akadns.net =>216.109.118.68

How DNS Works (The Two Key Functions)

Configuring DNS
* DNS 
* Information Stored in a Zone File 
* Text Files 
* Information About One or More Domains 
* S	tatic (Manually Updated) 
* Dynamic DNS 
* Same Process/Types on Information 
* Each Computer Dynamically Updates Its Information 
* RFC 
* Windows Server, Netware, etc


Placing DNS Servers on Internet
* Need Two Name Servers 
* Yours or ISP’s 
* Register with Name Register (Rnc.Ro)  
* Create a Host Record for Each Name Server (Host Name and IP Address) 
* Register Domain Names With the Host Names and IP Addresses of Name Servers 

Query DNS Packet Structure
QName – host name or query data (www.cs.ubbcluj.ro)
QType- A, PTR, MX, NS, SOA, etc
QClass – the query class (type of adressing- IN=Internet)


A single piece of information from the DNS database is called a resource record, or RR for short. Each record has a type associated with it, describing the sort of data it represents, and a class specifying the type of network it applies to. The latter accommodates the needs of different addressing schemes, like IP-addresses (the IN class), or addresses of Hesiod networks (used at MIT), and a few more. The prototypical resource record type is the A record which associates a fully qualified domain name with an IP-address.
